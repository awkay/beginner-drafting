= Basic Demo

This repository contains some demo code that shows
a very naive way of doing a React app with Clojurescript. It
is meant as a teaching tool for moving towards Fulcro.

I use this for my own teaching purposes. It really isn't meant
for public consumption, but you're welcome to play with it.
