= Basic Demo

This repository contains some demo code that shows
a very naive way of doing a React app with Clojurescript. It
is meant as a teaching tool for moving towards Fulcro.

I use this for my own teaching purposes. It really isn't meant
for public consumption, but you're welcome to play with it.

== Starting the Basic Demo

[source, bash]
-----
$ npm install
$ npx shadow-cljs server
-----

Go to http://localhost:9630/builds and start all of the builds.

Go to http://localhost:8081 for the naive project

Go to http://localhost:8080 for the regular Fulcro project

Go to http://localhost:8022 for the tests

== Recommendations

* Use Google Chrome
* Install the Fulcro Inspect extension
* Turn on "Custom Formatters" in the Devtools Preferences
* Open developer tools, and on the Network tab, Disable Cache. Now
when devtools is open you'll be sure to get fresh versions of compiled sources.
